      We specialize in coming up with great ideas and then half-assing them because
      everyone has jobs and other hobbies. Whatever.

        <a href="https://github.com/xtfc/mold">Mold</a>
      </header>
      <p>
        A fresh approach to managing common development tasks like running tests,
        checking code quality, or building documentation. Easily the most useful thing
        here.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Mold</strong> is heavily built around a few core ideas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reusable, parametrized modules that can be included via URL</li>
        <li>Documenting project tasks in a discoverable way</li>
        <li>Reducing complexity of task execution</li>
        <li>Using the same commands locally, in CI/CD, and production</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Get the ready-to-use shell script here:</p>
      <div id="getmold">
        <pre><code>curl -sSfL xtfc.org/mold.sh | sh</code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        <a href="https://xtfc.org/mold.sh">mold.sh</a> is a stand-in for the
        <strong>Mold</strong> binary. It's intended to be tracked by version control, so
        it's suitable for use in environments that don't already have Mold installed,
        like CI/CD or your coworker's computer. It does require the host environment to
        have internet access and <code>wget</code> or <code>curl</code>
        installed, as it transparently downloads a full binary to handle actual
        execution.

        A configuration language that's enjoyable by people and robots.
      </p>
      <p>
        I dunno. Mostly just read the
        <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl#why">HCL</a> explanation, but then
        throw in a paragraph about how I think HCL is kinda awkward sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plus it's just not very eXtreme.

        A modern, simplified porcelain for Git.
      </p>
      <p>
        Git's UX kinda sucks a lot. It has an absurd amount of command overloading,
        inconsistency between commands arguments, overwhelming complexity, unpleasant
        defaults, etc. <strong>Milk</strong>
        aims to cut back on a lot of these issues and provide a more user-friendly
        interface to Git.

        A modern terminal text editor.
      </p>

      <p>
        This aimed to separate the user-facing command / editing interface from the
        backend editor implementation. The approach was to ship a text editor that
        exposed its editing API as a Python module, but with no functionality configured
        by default. <strong>vx</strong> would source your <code>~/.vxrc.py</code> file
        within the scope of the editor, which could then configure any keybindings,
        syntax highlighting, windows / panes, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        It got half-assed pretty hard, but it was fun. Anyway, check out
        <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">xi</a>
        because it seems to be an even better idea.
