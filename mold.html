    <p>
      A fresh approach to managing common development tasks like running tests, checking
      code quality, or building documentation.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Mold</strong> is heavily built around a few core ideas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reusable, parameterized modules that can be included via URL</li>
      <li>Documenting project tasks in a discoverable way</li>
      <li>Reducing complexity of task execution</li>
      <li>Using the same commands locally, in CI/CD, and production</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By reusing parameterized modules, Mold enables new projects to
      <strong>rapidly</strong> get off the ground with a set of standard tasks. For
      example, <a href="https://github.com/xtfc/python.mold">python.mold</a>
      provides tasks for general Python project maintenance: autoformatting with
      <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a>, linting with
      <a href="http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/">flake8</a>, documentation
      generation with <a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx</a>,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      These modules can also provide <strong>consistency</strong> across projects from
      different teams, platforms, and toolchains: linting can generally be run with the
      <code>lint</code> recipe, tests can generally be run with the <code>test</code>
      recipe, etc. Consistency cuts down on time spent onboarding and adjusting after
      switching projects
    </p>
    <p>
      When consistency between projects can't be achieved completely, Mold makes your
      tasks <strong>discoverable</strong> and <strong>accessible</strong> without having
      to dig up the documentation. Simply running <code>mold</code> will list all of the
      magic spells in your project's grimoire.
    </p>

    <section>
      <header>Installation</header>
      <p>
        Check the
        <a href="https://github.com/xtfc/mold/releases">GitHub releases page</a> for
        binaries, or get the ready-to-use shell script here:
      </p>
      <div id="getmold">
        <pre><code>curl -sSfL xtfc.org/mold.sh | sh</code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        <a href="https://xtfc.org/mold.sh">mold.sh</a> is a stand-in for the
        Mold binary. It's intended to be tracked by version control, so
        it's suitable for use in environments that don't already have Mold installed,
        like CI/CD or your coworker's computer. It does require the host environment to
        have internet access and <code>wget</code> or <code>curl</code>
        installed, as it transparently downloads a full binary to handle actual
        execution.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <header>Usage</header>
      <p>
        Mold is so fun and easy to use. Just type <code>mold</code> (or
        maybe <code>./mold.sh</code>, if you're doing it that way). It should present
        you with a list of tasks and helpful descriptions. If you append a task name to
        the command, like <code>mold foo</code>, it will execute the
        <code>foo</code> task for you. You can run many tasks in sequence, like
        <code>mold foo bar</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's also some other junk sitting around if you run <code>mold --help</code>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <header>Reference</header>
      <p>
        Mold reads a recipe file that describes the available
        incantations and all sorts of fun parameterization options. Recipe files are
        written in <a href="https://yaml.org">YAML</a>. Maybe some day it will support
        <strong class="xcl">XCL</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A recipe file describes tasks that can be executed, script runtimes, environment
        variable definitions, and conditional environment configurations. It may also
        define a required minimum version of Mold.
      </p>

      <section>
        <header>Recipes</header>
        <p>
          A recipe describes a task that can be executed and can take any of several
          forms:
        </p>
        <p>
          A <strong>command</strong> is an executable and a list of arguments. It does
          not support any sort of variable substitution or interpolation; the list of
          arguments is used as a literal and passed straight to the OS for execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <strong>script</strong> is an inline script file and a script runtime. The
          inline script will be written to a temporary file and invoked using the script
          runtime. This is suitable for small scripts on the order of ~10 lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <strong>file</strong> is a separate script file, located in the
          <code>mold/</code> directory by default, and a script runtime. The file will
          be invoked using the script runtime. This is suitable for scripts of any size
          or language. The script file directory can be changed in the root of the
          recipe file.
        </p>

        <p>
          A <strong>module</strong> is a reference to a remote Git repository that
          contains a separate Mold configuration. Modules can target a
          specific branch / tag as well as a specific recipe file inside the repo.
          Recipes inside the module can be accessed with a prefix.
        </p>
        <p>
          All recipes can be configured with an optional help string, prerequisite
          tasks, environment variable definitions, and conditional environment variable
          definitions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <header>Runtimes</header>
        <p>
          A <strong>runtime</strong> defines an interpreter that can be used to execute
          scripts and files. Runtimes are defined by a name, command, and file
          extensions. The name is used as an identifier by scripts and files, so it must
          be unique. The command is a list of arguments that can be passed to the OS to
          execute the interpreter; any <code>"?"</code> elements will be replaced with
          the file to be executed. The file extensions are defined as a list of
          potential extensions to attach to a filename.
        </p>
        <p>
          See <a href="https://github.com/xtfc/std.mold">std.mold</a> for example
          runtime definitions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <header>Includes</header>
        <p>
          An <strong>include</strong> is a reference to a module that is included at the
          top-level, rather than behind a namespace prefix. This is useful for things
          like <a href="https://github.com/xtfc/std.mold">std.mold</a> that define
          general-purpose runtimes or recipes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          <strong>Environment variables</strong> are used to parameterize recipes. When
          using modules, it's often beneficial to use variables to ensure the module is
          generalized sufficiently. Variables can be configured at the root level or at
          an individual recipe level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mold automatically exports several environment
          variables that describe its runtime context:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code style="text-transform: none">$MOLD_ROOT</code>: directory containing the recipe file</li>
          <li><code style="text-transform: none">$MOLD_FILE</code>: recipe file path</li>
          <li><code style="text-transform: none">$MOLD_DIR</code>: recipe directory path</li>
          <li><code style="text-transform: none">$MOLD_CLONE_DIR</code>: directory containing module repositories</li>
          <li><code style="text-transform: none">$MOLD_SCRIPT_DIR</code>: directory containing temporary script files</li>
          <li><code style="text-transform: none">$MOLD_SEARCH_DIR</code>: directory searched for recipe files</li>
          <li><code style="text-transform: none">$MOLD_WORK_DIR</code>: working directory</li>
          <li><code style="text-transform: none">$MOLD_MODULE_ROOT</code>: directory containing recipe file for current recipe's module</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In simple configurations, several of the directories will be
          identical, but they can be useful in more complicated configurations
          involving nested modules.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <header>Conditional Environments</header>
        <p>
          <strong>Conditional environments</strong> allow environment variables to be
          defined based on a runtime setting. Environments are defined as a test
          expression and a variable map. The test is a simple expression that checks for
          the presence or absence of values in the active
          Mold environment list. If a test evaluates to
          <strong>true</strong>, the corresponding variable map will be applied.
          Conditional environments are applied in-order, overwriting values defined in
          the non-conditional <strong>variables</strong> map and in previous conditional
          environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Active environments</strong> are set as a comma-separated list of
          alphanumeric strings in the <code style="text-transform: none">$MOLDENV</code>
          environment variable or the <code>--env</code> / <code>-e</code> CLI flag.
          Additional environments can be appended one at a time using the
          <code>--add</code> / <code>-a</code> CLI flag.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Test expressions</strong> are written in a minimal language designed
          for checking combinations of active environments. Any environment identifier
          evaluates to <code>true</code> if that identifier is active. Boolean
          <code>and</code> is expressed with the <code>+</code> operator, while boolean
          <code>or</code> and <code>not</code> are expressed with the <code>|</code> and
          <code>~</code> operators, respectively. Subexpressions can be grouped using
          <code>()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Environment identifiers can also have underscores and hyphens. Whatever.
