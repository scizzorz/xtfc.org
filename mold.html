    <p>
      A fresh approach to managing common development tasks like running tests, checking
      code quality, or building documentation. Easily the most useful thing here.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Mold</strong> is heavily built around a few core ideas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reusable, parametrized modules that can be included via URL</li>
      <li>Documenting project tasks in a discoverable way</li>
      <li>Reducing complexity of task execution</li>
      <li>Using the same commands locally, in CI/CD, and production</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Get the ready-to-use shell script here:</p>
    <div id="getmold">
      <pre><code>curl -sSfL xtfc.org/mold.sh | sh</code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      <a href="https://xtfc.org/mold.sh">mold.sh</a> is a stand-in for the
      <strong>Mold</strong> binary. It's intended to be tracked by version control, so
      it's suitable for use in environments that don't already have Mold installed, like
      CI/CD or your coworker's computer. It does require the host environment to have
      internet access and <code>wget</code> or <code>curl</code>
      installed, as it transparently downloads a full binary to handle actual execution.
